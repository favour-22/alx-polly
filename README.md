# ALX Polly - Secure Polling Application

This document provides an overview of the ALX Polly application, with a special focus on the security vulnerabilities that were identified and the remediation steps taken to secure the platform.

## Project Overview

ALX Polly is a full-stack web application built with Next.js, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to register, create polls, and share them for voting. The project prioritizes security and follows modern web development best practices.

## Security Vulnerabilities and Remediation

A security audit of the application revealed critical vulnerabilities in the authentication system. These have been fully remediated. Below is a summary of the findings and the fixes that were implemented.

---

### 1. Insecure Registration Form (Client-Side Validation Bypass)

-   **Vulnerability:** The user registration form was performing password strength and confirmation checks only on the client side.
-   **Risk:** High. An attacker could easily bypass these client-side checks by disabling JavaScript or sending a direct request to the server. This would allow the creation of accounts with weak or non-compliant passwords, making them easy to compromise.
-   **Remediation:**
    1.  **Moved Validation to Server:** All validation logic, including password matching and strength checks (minimum length, character types), was moved into the `register` server action (`app/lib/actions/auth-actions.ts`).
    2.  **Server as Single Source of Truth:** The server is now the sole authority for validating new user accounts, completely mitigating the risk of a client-side bypass.
    3.  **Simplified Frontend:** The frontend component (`app/(auth)/register/page.tsx`) was refactored to remove the redundant client-side code, making it cleaner and more secure.

### 2. Insecure Login Form (Client-Side Validation and User Enumeration)

-   **Vulnerability:** The login form also relied on client-side validation, which could be bypassed. Furthermore, the error messages returned from the server were too specific (e.g., "Invalid login credentials"), which could allow an attacker to guess valid usernames (a technique known as user enumeration).
-   **Risk:** High. Bypassing client-side checks could facilitate brute-force attacks, while user enumeration could help an attacker identify valid targets.
-   **Remediation:**
    1.  **Server-Side Validation:** All login validation logic was moved to the `login` server action.
    2.  **Sanitized Error Messages:** The server action was updated to return a generic and secure error message ("Invalid email or password") for any failed login attempt. This prevents attackers from determining whether a failure was due to a bad password or a non-existent user.
    3.  **Removed Client-Side Logic:** The frontend login form was simplified, with all validation now handled securely on the server.

### 3. Authentication Middleware Bug (`AuthSessionMissingError`)

-   **Issue:** After the initial security fixes, the application began to experience an `AuthSessionMissingError`. This was caused by an improperly configured Next.js middleware file that failed to manage and refresh user sessions for server-side components.
-   **Risk:** Medium. While not a direct vulnerability, this bug broke authentication for legitimate users, making large parts of the application inaccessible.
-   **Remediation:**
    1.  **Updated Middleware:** The `middleware.ts` file was completely rewritten to use the official, recommended implementation from the Supabase documentation for `@supabase/ssr`.
    2.  **Reliable Session Management:** The new middleware correctly handles the user's session cookie, ensuring it is refreshed and made available to all server-side rendering and server action contexts. This stabilized the authentication flow across the entire application.

## Conclusion

By centralizing all validation logic on the server, sanitizing error messages, and implementing robust session management, the application's authentication system has been significantly hardened against common web vulnerabilities. The codebase is now more secure, resilient, and maintainable.
